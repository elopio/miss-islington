Backporting a PR on CPython
===========================

Prior to merging a PR, a Python core developer should apply the
``needs backport to X.Y`` label to the pull request.
Once the pull request has been merged, `@miss-islington <https://github.com/miss-islington>`_
will prepare the backport PR.

If `@miss-islington <https://github.com/miss-islington>`_ encountered any issue while backporting,
it will leave a comment about it. The PR then needs to be backported manually.


**Aside**: where does the name come from?
=========================================

According to Wikipedia, Miss Islington is the name of the witch in the
`Monty Python and the Holy Grail <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3jt5ibfRzw&feature=youtu.be>`_
sketch.
